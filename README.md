  This is a a collection of projects I created when I was part of a program called IESOSC. This stands for Innovation, Entrepreneurship, and the Science of Smart Cities. It taught me skills with cricuits such as building and coding them. It also taught me about the thinking that goes behind creating a product. We had to create an invention or innovation. My group and I made a wearable air purifier that was intended to the filter and clean air around you when you went outside.
